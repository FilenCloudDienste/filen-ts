    Analyze and strictly match the existing code style of any project before writing or editing code.
    Always use this skill whenever writing, editing, refactoring, or adding code to an existing codebase.
    This skill ensures you mirror the project's exact formatting conventions — indentation,
    quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, bracket spacing, line length, arrow function parens, brace
    style, empty lines, and more — by reading formatter config files and studying existing source files.
    Trigger this skill for ANY code contribution to an existing project, even small edits. Never guess
    style; always observe it first.

# Code Style Matching Skill

Before writing or modifying **any** code in an existing project, you must analyze and exactly replicate the project's code style. Never impose your own defaults. This skill defines how to do that systematically.

---

## Step 0: Check for Cached Style Index

**Always check for a cached index first** before doing any filesystem scanning. This saves significant tokens on repeated invocations.

```bash
cat ./claude/code-style-index.json 2>/dev/null
```

### If the index exists:

- Load and apply all style rules from it directly — **skip Steps 1–3**
- Proceed to **Step 4 (Resolve Conflicts)** and **Step 5 (Apply Exactly)**
- If you encounter style patterns during your work that are **not covered** by the index, append them (see **Step 6: Update the Index**)

### If the index does not exist:

- Proceed through Steps 1–3 to analyze the codebase
- After analysis, **always create the index** (see **Step 6: Create/Update the Index**)

---

## Step 1: Find and Read Formatter Config Files

_(Skip if index was found in Step 0)_

Immediately scan the project root (and relevant subdirectories) for config files. Read every one you find:

### Formatters & Linters to check

| Tool                  | Config files to look for                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **gofmt / goimports** | (implicit; check for `.editorconfig`)                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Rome**              | `rome.json`                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **EditorConfig**      | `.editorconfig` (applies to all languages)                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **TSConfig**          | `tsconfig.json` (affects TS strict settings, not formatting, but useful context)                                                                                                                                 |

**Action**: Run a quick find to locate these files:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name ".prettierrc*" -o -name "prettier.config.*" \
  -o -name ".eslintrc*" -o -name "eslint.config.*" \
  -o -name "biome.json" -o -name "biome.jsonc" \
  -o -name ".editorconfig" -o -name "rustfmt.toml" -o -name ".rustfmt.toml" \
  -o -name "ruff.toml" -o -name ".ruff.toml" -o -name "dprint.json" \
  -o -name "oxlint.json" \) 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Also check `package.json` for inline config:

```bash
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A 30 '"prettier"'
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A 30 '"eslintConfig"'
```

---

## Step 2: Extract Key Style Rules

_(Skip if index was found in Step 0)_

From the config files, extract and note all settings.

---

## Step 3: Study Existing Source Files

_(Skip if index was found in Step 0)_

Even with config files, always verify with real code samples. Pick **all representative files** of the same type you'll be editing:

```bash
# Examples

# For JS/TS projects
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" | grep -v node_modules | head -1000

# For Rust
find . -name "*.rs" | grep -v target | head -1000

# For Python
find . -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | head -1000
```

Read the files and check **every one** of these:

### Checklist — observe directly from source

- [ ] **Indentation**: spaces or tabs? how many?
- [ ] **Quotes**: single `'` or double `"`? Template literals `` ` ``?
- [ ] **Semicolons**: present or absent at end of statements?
- [ ] **Trailing commas**: after last item in arrays, objects, params, imports?
- [ ] **Object bracket spacing**: `{ key: value }` or `{key: value}`?
- [ ] **Arrow parens**: `(x) => x` or `x => x`?
- [ ] **Brace style**: opening `{`, `[]` or `(` on same line or new line?
- [ ] **Print width**: approximate line length before wrapping
- [ ] **Import style**: named vs default, grouped, sorted?
- [ ] **Empty lines**: between functions? between class members? at top/bottom of blocks? between variables?
- [ ] **Type annotations** (TS): inline, separate, style of generics spacing
- [ ] **String concatenation vs template literals**
- [ ] **Ternary formatting**: inline or multiline?
- [ ] **Array/object multiline threshold**: when do they break to multiple lines?
- [ ] **Comment style**: `//` vs `/* */`, JSDoc style, spacing after `//`
- [ ] **Export style**: named, default, barrel pattern?
- [ ] **Multiline**: Single-property objects passed as arguments are still expanded to multiple lines: run(fn, {\n\tthrow: true\n}) for better readability
- [ ] **Multiline**: Inline defer callbacks are forbidden — always expand the body: defer(() => {\n\tthis.x.release()\n}) for better readability
- [ ] **Switch cases**: Curly braces for cases for better readability, with a line break between each case

---

## Step 4: Resolve Conflicts

If config and source code disagree, **source code wins** — it reflects what's actually enforced and committed. Config files may be outdated or partially applied.

If different files of the same type show different styles (e.g., some use 2 spaces, some 4), match the **majority pattern** and note the inconsistency. Don't introduce a third style.

---

## Step 5: Apply Exactly

When writing or editing code:

1. **Match every observed convention** — no exceptions, no personal defaults
2. **Never silently "improve" formatting** — if the project uses 4 spaces, use 4 spaces even if you prefer 2
3. **Don't add or remove trailing commas, semis, or parens** unless that's what the project uses
4. **Match empty line patterns** exactly — between functions, before returns, around imports
5. **Match comment style** — if comments use `// ` with a space, don't use `//without`
6. **Match import ordering** — if imports are grouped and sorted, follow the same grouping

---

## Step 6: Create/Update the Style Index

The index lives at `./claude/code-style-index.json`. It is a project-local cache that prevents full codebase re-scanning on future invocations.
If you are in a monorepo, the index file parent directory lives at the project root.

### Creating the index (after first full scan)

After completing Steps 1–3, write all discovered rules to the index:

```bash
mkdir -p ./claude
```

Then write `./claude/code-style-index.json` with this structure:

```json
{
	"_meta": {
		"created": "<ISO date>",
		"updated": "<ISO date>",
		"note": "Auto-generated by code-style skill. Commit this file."
	},
	"indentation": {
		"style": "spaces",
		"size": 2
	},
	"quotes": {
		"js": "single",
		"jsx": "single",
		"ts": "single",
		"tsx": "single",
		"py": "double"
	},
	"semicolons": true,
	"trailingCommas": "es5",
	"bracketSpacing": true,
	"arrowParens": "always",
	"printWidth": 100,
	"endOfLine": "lf",
	"braceStyle": "1tbs",
	"emptyLines": {
		"betweenFunctions": 1,
		"betweenImportGroups": 1,
		"atTopOfBlock": 0
	},
	"imports": {
		"style": "named-preferred",
		"groupOrder": ["builtin", "external", "internal", "relative"],
		"sorted": true
	},
	"comments": {
		"inline": "// ",
		"block": "/* */"
	},
	"exports": {
		"style": "named"
	},
	"notes": []
}
```

Only include keys you actually observed — omit fields you couldn't determine. Add free-form observations to the `"notes"` array (e.g., `"Ternaries always written inline unless > 80 chars"`).

### Updating the index (when new patterns are found)

During any coding session, if you observe a style pattern **not yet recorded** in the index:

1. Read the current index
2. Add or update the relevant field(s)
3. Update `_meta.updated` to today's date
4. Write the file back

Examples of update triggers:

- You notice ternaries are always multiline but `ternaries` isn't in the index → add it
- You see a consistent JSDoc pattern not captured → add to `comments`
- You find an exception for test files (e.g., 4-space indent in `*.test.ts`) → add a `"fileTypeOverrides"` key

**Never remove existing entries** unless they are factually wrong. Add a note instead if there's ambiguity.

---

## Step 7: When Adding New Files

If creating a new file from scratch in an existing project:

- Apply the exact same conventions as sibling files of the same type
- Don't use your own defaults — extrapolate from existing patterns
- If a formatter is configured, write code as if the formatter will be run (i.e., write what the formatter would produce)

---

## Important Reminders

- **Always check `./claude/code-style-index.json` first** — only scan the full codebase if it's missing
- **Always create the index** after a full scan so future invocations are cheaper
- **Always update the index** when you observe uncaptured style rules
- **EditorConfig is language-agnostic** and often overrides tool-specific settings for indentation — always read it
- **Monorepos** may have per-package configs — find the config closest to the file being edited; consider per-package index files (e.g., `./packages/api/claude/code-style-index.json`).
- **Don't run the formatter yourself** unless asked — just write code that would pass formatting unchanged
- **When in doubt, look at more files** — patterns become obvious with 3–5 examples
- **Commit the index file** — it should live in version control so the whole team benefits
